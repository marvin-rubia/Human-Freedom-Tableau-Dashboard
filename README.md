# Human-Freedom-Tableau-Dashboard
This repository provides the source data and the links to visualizations and the blog for the Tableau Public dashboard I created for the Human Freedom Index.

## What is the Human Freedom Index?
"The Human Freedom Index presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom. Human freedom is a social concept that recognizes the dignity of individuals and is defined here as negative liberty or the absence of coercive constraint. Because freedom is inherently valuable and plays a role in human progress, it is worth measuring carefully. The Human Freedom Index is a resource that can help to more objectively observe relationships between freedom and other social and economic phenomena, as well as the ways in which the various dimensions of freedom interact with one another." - HFI 2022, [Cato Institute website](https://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index/2022)

## My motivation
I want my dashboard to answer this question: _how does your country’s human freedom compare with the rest of the world_?

I want to raise awareness among people about the inequality in this world. Coercive constraints are put in place by corrupt politicians to maintain or achieve their power. Women are still controlled by men in some countries. Curious journalists are silenced. And many are still not free to love the same-sex person they deserve.

Some people were unlucky to be born in a country that is controlling in many aspects of life. Data visualization and storytelling help us ask why.

## Interact with my dashboard
Check your country’s Human Freedom score by interacting with my Tableau Public dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/marvin.rubia/viz/HumanFreedom_16921091160550/HumanFreedomDashboard?publish=yes). Note: It is best viewed via laptop or desktop in full-screen window. 

## I wrote a blog about this
Read my blog for my thought process of designing the dashboard and some insights about our planet's human freedom condition here: [Creating a Tableau Dashboard for Human Freedom Index](https://marvinrubia.medium.com/creating-a-tableau-dashboard-for-human-freedom-index-a71873e62016).

## Here's an animation for the Top 25 countries from 2000 to 2020

NOTE: I coded this animated visualization in Google Colab using the `bar_chart_race` library. I wrote a blog on how to create this animation here: [Racing Bar Chart Visualization: Countries with the Most Freedom, 2000–2020](https://python.plainenglish.io/racing-bar-chart-visualization-countries-with-the-most-freedom-e5d81506838a).
